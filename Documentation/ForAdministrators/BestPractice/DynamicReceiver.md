# Predefined Receiver

In some case it could be useful, that the email receiver should be chosen by a selectfield value.
E.g. if the visitor selects "receiver A" or "country B" in a dropdown, powermail should use
receivera@domain.org and in all other cases receiverb@domain.org

## Activate Predefined Receiver

You can add a new option to the predefined receiver with a bit of page TSConfig

`tx_powermail.flexForm.predefinedReceivers.addFieldOptions.receivers1 = receivers #1`

## Conditional receiver via TypoScript


### Small example

In a simple example rec1@domain.org and rec2@domain.org should be always used, if the editor chooses "receivers2"
in the plugin dropdown:

```
plugin.tx_powermail.settings.setup.receiver.predefinedReceiver {
    receivers2.email = TEXT
    receivers2.email.value = rec1@domain.org, rec2@domain.org
}
```


### Dynamic example 1

In a bit more advanced example, we want to choose the receiver by a given value (e.g. of a select box).
If value 1 is given in a field with marker `{receiver}`, `receivera@domain.org` should be chosen
and if value 2 or something else is given, `receiverb@domain.org` should be chosen.
See following TypoScript setup example:

```
plugin.tx_powermail.settings.setup.receiver.predefinedReceiver {

    receivers1.email = CASE
    receivers1.email {

        key.data = GP:tx_powermail_pi1|field|receiver

        1 = TEXT
        1.value = receivera@domain.org

        default = TEXT
        default.value = receiverb@domain.org
    }
}
```


### Dynamic example 2

Here is another advanced example how to set a different email address for the receiver, by changing an integer
into a frontend user email address (get it from database fe_users.email by given fe_users.uid).
We just use some lines of TypoScript with cObject CONTENT (example for TYPO3 8).
See following TypoScript setup example:

```
# Get Email address from fe_users by given POST-parameter
lib.receiver = CONTENT
lib.receiver {
    table = fe_users
    select {
        # Page with fe_users records
        pidInList = 33

        where {
            # UID of the fe_users record is given in field with marker {receiver}
            data = GP:tx_powermail_pi1|field|receiver

            wrap = uid=|
            intval = 1
        }
    }
    renderObj = TEXT
    renderObj {
            field = email
    }
}

plugin.tx_powermail.settings.setup.receiver.predefinedReceiver.receivers3.email < lib.receiver
```

Additional note
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lib.receiver from the last example can also be used with predefined receivers or directly via
cObjectViewHelper in the receiver field in FlexForm - like:
*{f:cObject(typoscriptObjectPath:'lib.receiver')}*
