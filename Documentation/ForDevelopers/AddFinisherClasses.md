# Add Finisher Classes

## Introduction

Let's say you want easily add some own php functions that
should be called after a user submits a form or
if you want to override original Finishers from powermail,
a Finisher is the best choice.

Maybe you want to handle the user input to:

* Send it to an API
* Store it in a logfile
* Save it into a table
* Something else...

## Small example

Just define which classes should be used. Every method like \*Finisher() will be called - e.g. myFinisher():

```
plugin.tx_powermail.settings.setup {
   finishers {
       1 {
           class = Vendor\Ext\Finisher\DoSomethingFinisher
       }
   }
}
```


Add a php-file `DoSomethingFinisher.php` and extend your class with the AbstractFinisher from powermail:

```
<?php
namespace Vendor\Ext\Finisher;

use In2code\Powermail\Finisher\AbstractFinisher;

/**
* Class DoSomethingFinisher
*
* @package Vendor\Ext\Finisher
*/
class DoSomethingFinisher extends AbstractFinisher
{

   /**
    * MyFinisher
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function myFinisher()
   {
       // do some magic ...
   }
}
```


## Extended example

See the advanced example with some configuration
in TypoScript and with the possibility to load the file
(useful if file could not be loaded from autoloader
because it's stored in fileadmin or elsewhere)

```
plugin.tx_powermail.settings.setup {
   finishers {
       1 {
           # Classname that should be called with method *Finisher()
           class = Vendor\Ext\Finisher\DoSomethingFinisher

           # optional: Add configuration for your PHP
           config {
               foo = bar

               fooCObject = TEXT
               fooCObject.value = do something with this text
           }

           # optional: If file will not be loaded from autoloader, add path and it will be called with require_once
           require = fileadmin/powermail/finisher/DoSomethingFinisher.php
       }
   }
}
```


Add your php-file `DoSomethingFinisher.php` again and extend your class with the abstract class AbstractFinisher
from powermail:

```
<?php
namespace Vendor\Ext\Finisher;

use In2code\Powermail\Domain\Model\Mail;
use In2code\Powermail\Finisher\AbstractFinisher;

/**
* Class DoSomethingFinisher
*
* @package Vendor\Ext\Finisher
*/
class DoSomethingFinisher extends AbstractFinisher
{

   /**
    * @var Mail
    */
   protected $mail;

   /**
    * @var array
    */
   protected $configuration;

   /**
    * @var array
    */
   protected $settings;

   /**
    * Will be called always at first
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function initializeFinisher()
   {
   }

   /**
    * Will be called before myFinisher()
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function initializeMyFinisher()
   {
   }

   /**
    * MyFinisher
    *
    * @return void
    */
   public function myFinisher()
   {
       // get value from configuration
       $foo = $this->configuration['foo'];

       // get subject from mail
       $subject = $this->getMail()->getSubject();

       // get a value by markername
       $value = $this->getMail()->getAnswersByFieldMarker()['markerName']->getValue();

       // get a value by field uid
       $value = $this->getMail()->getAnswersByFieldUid()[123]->getValue();

       // do some more magic ...
   }
}
```

## Some notices

* All methods which are ending with "finisher" will be called - e.g. `saveFinisher()`.
* The method `initializeFinisher()` will always be called at first.
* Every finisher method could have its own initialize method, which will be called before. Like `initializeMyFinisher()` before `myFinisher()`.
* Classes in extensions (if namespace and filename fits) will be automatically included from TYPO3 autoloader. If you place a single file in fileadmin, use "require" in TypoScript.
* Per default 10, 20 and 100 is already in use from powermail itself (SaveToAnyTableFinisher, SendParametersFinisher, RedirectFinisher).
