# Country

## What does it do?

- **General:** This field is rendered as selectfield (see above). But the field is filled with countries. Per default the countrylist is a static list. If you want to change the sorting, value or labels, use the extension static_info_tables and have a look into the country partial HTML-File.
- **Prefill:** Country field can be preselected with it's value (like DEU for Germany)
