# Captcha Field

## What does it do?

- **General:** Want to prevent spam? Spamshield is integrated in powermail 2.x. In addtion you can add a calculating-captcha field to the form. The form can only be submitted if the result of the captcha is correct. You can use another captcha extension instead of the build-in calculating captcha (see TypoScript part).
