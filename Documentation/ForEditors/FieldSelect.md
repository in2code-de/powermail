# Selectfield

## What does it do?

- **General:** A select field is also called "dropdown", "combobox" or "picklist". The user can choose an option. It's also possible to config a multiselectfield - the user can choose more than only one option by holding the CRTL-Key when clicking a second option. Add some options and separate it with a new line.
- **Mandatory:** This field could be marked as mandatory, so the user must fill out this field, otherwise the form can not be submitted.
- **Prefill:** The field can be preselected from FlexForm, TypoScript, GET/Post-Params or from FE_User table.
- **Special:** Options could also filled by TypoScript in powermail 2.1 and higher (static or dynamic)
