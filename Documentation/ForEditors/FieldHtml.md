# Show HTML

## What does it do?

- **General:** If you want to show some html-text in the form, use this field. This text is not submitted. Per default the text is parsed through a htmlspecialchars() function, which makes no HTML tags possible.
 If your editors are aware of possible security problems, the admin can enable HTML under Constants::

  plugin.tx_powermail.settings.misc.htmlForHtmlFields = 1.
