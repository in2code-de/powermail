# Mail Backend Module

## Introduction

Per default powermails adds a new backend module to the TYPO3 backend.
This module helps you to manage mails and forms.

### First step

Open the Mail Backend Module and choose a page with mails in the foldertree. You will see all stored mails.

splitted into two parts (Search part and Export part).
