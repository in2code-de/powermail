What does it do?
''''''''''''''''

- **General:** A texarea basicly works like a normal input field, but offers the possibility to write in multiple lines.
- **Mandatory:** This field could be marked as mandatory, so the user must fill out this field, otherwise the form can not be submitted.
- **Validation:** This field can also be validated (HTML5, JavaScript and/or PHP) for different inputtypes (email, url, phone, numbers only, letters only, min number, max number, range, length, pattern)
- **Prefill:** An input field can be prefilled from FlexForm, TypoScript, GET/Post-Params or from FE_User table.
