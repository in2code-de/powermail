# Hidden Field

## What does it do?

- **General:** It could be useful to send some values within the form, that should not be displayed in frontend. Use a hidden field for this.
- **Prefill:** This field can be prefilled from FlexForm, TypoScript, GET/Post-Params or from FE_User table.

## Frontend Output Example

Because it is "hidden", there is no visible frontend output :)

|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Title                              | Add a label for this field.                                                       | The label is shown in the frontend near to this field.                                                                                                                                | General  |
| Type                               | Choose a fieldtype.                                                               | See explanation below for a special fieldtype. Different fields are  related to some fieldtypes – not all fields are shown on every type.                                             | General  |
| Email of sender                    | Check this if this field contains the email of the sender.                        | This is needed to set the correct sender-email-address. If there is no  field marked as Senderemail within the current form, powermail will use a  default value for the Senderemail. | General  |
| Name of sender                     | Check this if this field contains the name (or a part of the name) of the sender. | This is needed to set the correct sender-name. If there is no field  marked as Sendername within the current form, powermail will use a  default value for the Sendername.            | General  |
| Prefill with value                 | Prefill field value with a static content.                                        | Other possibilities to prefill a field: TypoScript, GET or POST params                                                                                                                | Extended |
| Value from logged in Frontend User | Check if field should be filled from the FE_Users table of a logged in fe_user.   | This value overwrites a static value, if set.                                                                                                                                         | Extended |
| Variables – Individual Fieldname   | This is a marker of this field.                                                   | Use a field variable with {marker} in any RTE or HTML-Template. The marker name is equal in any language.                                                                             | Extended |
| Add own Variable                   | Check this, if you want to set your own marker (see row before).                  | After checking this button, TYPO3 ask you to reload. After a reload, you see a new field for setting an own marker.                                                                   | Extended |
| Language                           | Choose a language.                                                                | Choose in which frontend language this record should be rendered.                                                                                                                     | Access   |
