### 3.4. Product Owner

The product owner and author of the extension is Alex Kellner from [in2code](https://www.in2code.de). Beside that every
in2code colleague is allowed to support further development if she/he wants. In addition there are a lot of other
contributors that helped to improve the extension with their *Pull Requests* - thank you for that!

### 3.5. Release Management

Powermail uses **semantic versioning** which basically means for you, that
- **bugfix updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.0.1) just includes small bugfixes or security relevant stuff without breaking changes.
- **minor updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.1.0) includes new features and smaller tasks without breaking changes.
- **major updates** (e.g. 1.0.0 => 2.0.0) normally includes basic refactoring, new features and also breaking changes.

We try to mark breaking changes in the [changelog](/Documentation/Changelog/Readme.md)
with a leading **!!!** and try to explain what to do on an upgrade (e.g. VieHelper name changed from vh:foo to vh:bar in templates).

In addition powermail is using [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) as Git workflow.
That means that there is one branch which contains new and untested code: **develop**.
The branch **master** only contains tested code which will also be tagged from time to time.

Based on `release early, release often` we try to release new versions as often as possible into TER and to github/packagist.

### 3.6. Automatic Testing

#### Behaviour tests

There is a huge testparcours that have to be passed before every release. For example there is an
[automatic test](/Tests/Behavior/Features/Pi1/Validation/Input/JsPhpValidation.feature)
where the browser tries to submit 18 different strings and numbers to a field that accepts only phone numbers to test
serverside validation. After that the same process is done for clientside valiation.
There are also some smaller tests like "Is it possible to submit a form on a page where two different forms are stored?".

See [readme.md](/Tests/Behavior/readme.md) for some more information about behat and selenium tests on powermail.

#### Unit tests

At the moment powermail offers 543 (and growing) unit tests that have to be passed before every release. See more information
about unit tests or code coverage in powermail in the [readme.md](/Tests/Unit/readme.md)

### 3.7. Code quality

Beside respecting PSR-2 and TYPO3 coding guidelines, it's very important for the project to leave a file cleaner as before.
Especially because it's a really large extension with a lot of functionality and a history of 10 years (!) and of course some
technical debts, that have to be fixed step by step (e.g. moving logic completely to Domain folder, ...).
Look at [Sonarqube](https://ter-sonarqube.marketing-factory.de/dashboard?id=powermail) for some interesting details on that.

### 3.8. Contribution

**Pull requests** are welcome in general! Nevertheless please don't forget to add a description to your pull requests. This
is very helpful to understand what kind of issue the **PR** is going to solve.

- Bugfixes: Please describe what kind of bug your fix solve and give us feedback how to reproduce the issue. We're going
to accept only bugfixes if I can reproduce the issue.
- Features: Not every feature is relevant for the bulk of powermail users. In addition: We don't want to make powermail
even more complicated in usability for an edge case feature. Please discuss a new feature before.


### 3.9. Development

Compile and minify (uglify) JavaScript, compress CSS:

```
$ cd Resources/Private
$ npm install
$ ./node_modules/.bin/gulp
```
